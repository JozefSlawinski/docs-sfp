# Generating a changelog

sfp's release command will automate generating a change log that will help the team to understand what are the constituent work items/commits that are part of the release and which artifacts where impacted and what was installed

Here is an example of the changelog that is generated by sfp\


<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A changelog in markdown format rendered in Github</p></figcaption></figure>

The changelog is available as both as a markdown file and also as an associated json file that has the all the necessary information to render the change log accordingly for instance in a different tool

One can instruct the release command to generate the changelog by utilizing the below flags

<pre><code><strong>  -b, --branchname=&#x3C;value>            Repository branch in which the changelog files are located
</strong>  --generatechangelog                 Create a release changelog

</code></pre>

For eg in the below release command, the release command looks for exisiting `releasechangelog.json` to understand the previous release deployed in the environment and it would append the changelog information to both `releasechangelog.json` and `Release-Changelog.md` file

```yaml
sfp release -u prod \
            -p  releasedefn.yaml \
            --npm --scope flxbl \
            -v prod \
             --generatechangelog --branchname changelog
```

Additional attributes to control changelog links for instance are available in the [release definition ](release-definitions.md)

### Identifying work items

Change log displays work item by identify attributes in commit message using a simple regex pattern as provided in the workItemFilters section of your release definition. \
\
For instance, given a  commit message  with the following message , the work item BE-1836 is identified by the work item filter `` BE-[0-9]{2,5}` ``&#x20;

```
fix/BE-1836: ⚡ added Config changes for Field type changes (#1629)
* fix: ⚡ added Config changes for Field type changes
```

sfp will identify the part BE-1836 and add  a URL link to your work item tracking system by using the provided `workItemUrl` attribute

### &#x20;Generating changelog individually

sfp also has standalone commands to generate changelog to create changelog out of bound of the normal release command .  One can use the `changelog generate` command for eg:

<pre class="language-yaml"><code class="lang-yaml"> sfp changelog generate -b releasedefns \
                        -d artifacts \
                        -w "(<a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">FGK|FFK)-[0-9]{3,4}"</a> \
                        -r "<a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-2">https://adiza.atlassian.net/browse</a>" \
                        -n Release-1 \
                       --directory changelog
</code></pre>
