An artifact is a key concept within sfp.   An artifact is a just in time snapshot of a version of a package, as mentioned in sfdx-project.json .  The snapshot contains source code of a package directory , additional metadata information regarding the particular version, changelog  and other details.  An artifact  for 2GP package would also contain details such as [Subscriber Package Version ID](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx\_dev.meta/sfdx\_dev/sfdx\_dev\_unlocked\_pkg\_pkg\_ids.htm)&#x20;

\
Artifacts  provide an abstraction over version control, as it detaches the version control from from the point of releasing into a salesforce org. Almost all commands in sfp operates on an artifact or generates an artifact. \

In the context of **sfp**, an **artifact** represents a more enhanced concept compared to a Salesforce package. While it is based on a Salesforce package  or specific package types introduce by sfp,  an artifact in sfp includes additional attributes and metadata that describe the package version, dependencies, installation behavior, and other context-specific information relevant to the CI/CD process. Artifacts in sfp are designed to be more than just a bundle of code and metadata; they encapsulate the package along with its CI/CD lifecycle information, making them more aligned with DevOps practices.\
\
sfp's artifacts are built to be compatible for npm package supported registries ,  most CI/CD providers provide a npm compatible registry to host these packages/artifacts.  Here is the link to operate on Github Package Manager for instance ([https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry))

Artifacts built by sfp follow a naming convention that  starts with the \<name\_of\_the\_package>_sfpowerscripts\_artifact\_\<Major>.\<Minor>.\<Patch>-\<BuildNumber>._ One can use any of the npm commands to interact with sfp artifacts.  \
