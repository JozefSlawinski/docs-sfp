# Commands

sfp has re-organized the topics and commands so existing commands used in the current pipeline scripts will need to reflect the changes to ensure a seamless transition to Flxbl.  Although best efforts have been made to create aliases for the legacy commands, we recommend all users review and update their scripts to reflect the latest commands and flags that have been updated.
