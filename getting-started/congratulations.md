# Congratulations!

Good Work! If you made it past the getting started guide with minimal errors and questions, you are well on your way to introduce sfp into your Salesforce Delivery workflow.

Let's summarize what you have done:

1. Setup pre-requisite software on your workstation and have access to a Salesforce Org.
2. Installed the latest sfp cli.
3. Configured your source project and added additional properties required for sfp cli to generate artifacts.
4. Build artifact(s) locally to be used to deploy.
5. Installed artifact(s) to target org.

This is just the tip of the iceberg for the full features sfp can provide for you and your team.  Please continue to read further and experiment.

For any comments/recommendations to sfp so please join our [Slack Community](https://www.launchpass.com/flxblio).  If you are adventurous, contribute!
