# Congratulations!

Good Work! If you made it past the getting started guide with minimal errors and questions, you are well on your way to a better way to develop and release on the Salesforce Platform.

Let's summarize what you have done:

1. Setup pre-requisite software on your workstation and have access to a Salesforce Org.
2. Installed the latest sfp cli.
3. Configured your source project and added additional properties required for sfp cli to generate artifacts.
4. Build Artifacts locally.
5. Installed Built Artifact to target org.
6. Verified changes in target org and reviewed details of the package details in the Custom Settings.



This is just the tip of the iceberg for the full features sfp can provide for you and your team.  Please continue to read further and experiment.

We welcome any comments/recommendations to sfp so please join our [Slack Community](https://www.launchpass.com/flxblio) and if you are adventurous, contribute!
