# Defining a pool

Pools are defined by creating a pool definition file.  The file can be placed in a directory within your repository. \


The below configuration details a pool with tag 'DEV-POOL'  allocated with 20 scratch orgs.  Read on below to understand other configurations that are available &#x20;

```
{
    "tag": "DEV-POOL",
    "maxAllocation": 20,
    "expiry": 10,
    "batchSize": 10,
    "configFilePath": "config/project-scratch-def.json",
    "relaxAllIPRanges": true,
    "installAll": true,
    "enableSourceTracking": true,
    "retryOnFailure": true,
    "succeedOnDeploymentErrors": true,
    "fetchArtifacts": {
        "npm": {
            "scope": "myproject",
    }
}
```





The latest JSON schema for scratch org pool configuration can be found[ here.](https://github.com/dxatscale/sfpowerscripts/blob/main/packages/core/resources/pooldefinition.schema.json)â€‹\
\
The `pool prepare` command accepts a JSON configuration file that defines settings and attributes of the scratch org pool. The properties accepted by the configuration file are shown in the table below.
