Building an artifact is a central concept within sfp.  Artifacts  provide an abstraction over version control, as it detaches the version control from from the point of releasing into a salesforce org. Almost all commands in sfp operates on an artifact which contains source code of a package directory ( as mentioned in your sfdx-project.json), additional metadata information, changelog  and other details.&#x20;
