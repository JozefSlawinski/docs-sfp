An artifact is a key concept within sfp.  Artifacts  provide an abstraction over version control, as it detaches the version control from from the point of releasing into a salesforce org. Almost all commands in sfp operates on an artifact which contains source code of a package directory ( as mentioned in your sfdx-project.json), additional metadata information, changelog  and other details.&#x20;

sfp's artifacts are built to be compatible for npm package supported registries ,  most CI/CD providers provide a npm compatible registry to host these packages/artifacts.  Here is the link to operate on Github Package Manager for instance ([https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry))
